# ❤️ Framingham Heart Study Analysis

This project analyzes the **Framingham Heart Study dataset**, a well-known dataset in healthcare and epidemiology.  
The goal is to explore factors that influence the risk of **coronary heart disease (CHD)** and to build predictive machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Perform **data cleaning** (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distributions of age, gender, cholesterol, BMI, smoking, etc.
  - Correlation heatmaps.
  - Survival risk by different factors.
- Build and evaluate **Machine Learning models** to predict 10-year CHD risk.
- Evaluate models with:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
